# Even Fibonacci Numbers

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

## Solution

### Initial thoughts

My first thoughts are to create an iterator that yields Fibonacci numbers. It should yield the next Fibonacci number each time it is called.
I will then extend this iterator to only yield even numbers and then sum of those whose value is less than 4 million.
